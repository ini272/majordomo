**majordomo - Project Kickstart Document**

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name (working):** majordomo
**Goal:** Gamify household tasks and chores by turning them into RPG-style quests. Users gain XP, loot, and achievements, creating a dopamine loop similar to gaming experiences.
**Audience:** Initially personal/self-hosted, possibly extended later.

**Core Ideas:**

* Turn rooms/zones in the house into RPG-style zones (Kitchen = Forge, Living Room = Great Hall, etc.)
* Tasks become quests (daily/weekly/mega-tasks)
* Reward system: XP, loot drops, achievements
* Sound effects and animations for feedback (WoW-inspired level-up and quest-complete sounds)
* Optional integrations: Home Assistant for event-based quest triggers, Discord bot for quick command interactions.

---

## 2. Key Features

1. **Quest System**

   * Auto-generated quests or templated quests
   * Different tiers: Daily, Weekly, Mega tasks
   * Optional flavor text generation for immersion

2. **Progression & Rewards**

   * XP system with levels
   * Loot tables with rarity tiers
   * Achievements and badges

3. **Integration & Automation**

   * Home Assistant triggers (trash lid, dishwasher, motion sensors)
   * REST API endpoints for event-based quest spawning
   * Optional Discord bot for text command interactions

4. **Frontend Experience**

   * React + Vite
   * TailwindCSS for quick styling
   * Framer Motion for animations (level-ups, loot drops, confetti)
   * PWA support for mobile install and offline usage

5. **Backend & Data Management**

   * FastAPI for REST endpoints and WebSockets
   * SQLModel + SQLite for local DB (migratable to Postgres later)
   * Optional Alembic for migrations
   * Simple API structure for CRUD operations (quests, rewards, XP logs, templates)

6. **Gamification Logic**

   * XP scaling based on task difficulty
   * Loot drops with variable rarity
   * Quest bundles for multi-step routines
   * Optional AI assistance for quest text, loot flavor, and XP suggestions

## 3. Project Philosophy & Design Principles

* **Ease of use:** Quest creation should be effortless; use auto-generation, templates, quick-add buttons, and possibly voice commands.
* **Extendable & modular:** System should support future expansions: new quest types, animations, gamification mechanics, integrations.
* **Incremental AI usage:** AI is a co-pilot, not a pilot. Use it for scaffolding, brainstorming, debugging, and generating flavor content incrementally.

## 4. Tech Stack Recommendation

### Backend

* **FastAPI**: lightweight, async-friendly, compatible with SQLModel
* **SQLModel + SQLite**: simple ORM + validation, easy local DB, scalable to Postgres
* **WebSockets**: for real-time updates (level-ups, quest spawning)

### Frontend

* **React + Vite**: fast and minimal, good for MVP
* **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui**: styling and accessible components
* **Framer Motion**: animations for reward feedback
* **PWA**: mobile install, offline support

### Integrations

* **Home Assistant**: REST endpoints for events (e.g., dishwasher done → spawn quest)
* **Optional Discord bot**: slash commands for quest completion
* **Sound**: browser Audio API for quest/level/loot sounds

### Optional AI Assistant

* For scaffolding and routine code generation (Cursor, Copilot)
* For creative tasks like flavor text, loot ideas, quest descriptions (ChatGPT)
* Use incrementally to avoid mental overload

## 6. Next Steps / Immediate Kickoff Tasks

1. Scaffold backend with FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite
2. Define initial data models: Quest, Reward, XPLog, Templates
3. Set up basic frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion
4. Implement simple CRUD endpoints for quests and rewards
5. Create MVP UI to display quests, mark complete, award XP
6. Add basic animations and sound effects for quest completion
7. Experiment with Home Assistant integration via simple REST calls
8. Optional: Integrate AI assistance for scaffold generation and flavor text
