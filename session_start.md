# Session Start

Majordomo motivates a household builder/user to complete real chores using RPG mechanics (quests, XP, gold, rewards, progression).
Builder profile: pragmatic, curious, likes brainstorming the right approach, accepts refactoring.
Source of truth: trust the code first; if unsure, re-read the code before trusting docs or assumptions.
Startup backend (local): `cd backend && uv sync && uv run python main.py`
