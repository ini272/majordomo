# Session Start

Majordomo motivates a household builder/user to complete real chores using RPG mechanics (quests, XP, gold, rewards, progression).
Goal/context: keep that motivational loop useful in real life for me first, and potentially my girlfriend.
Primary user: me (and possibly my girlfriend in shared household use).
Builder profile: pragmatic, curious, likes brainstorming the right approach, accepts refactors, and wants deep understanding (not surface-level).

Agent priority: optimize for fast, accurate bootstrapping with minimal token usage.
Source of truth: trust the code first; if unsure, re-read the code before trusting docs or assumptions.
Startup (local): `cd backend && uv sync && uv run python main.py`
