## Vision

Make household chores feel like a cooperative RPG: clear tasks, visible progress, and meaningful rewards.

## Product principles

- Mobile-first interaction
- Self-hosted simplicity
- Low-friction quest creation/completion
- Household privacy and local control
- Incremental feature growth from a stable core loop

## Core loop

1. Create or generate quests from templates/AI/random
2. Complete quests to gain XP and gold
3. Spend gold on rewards/consumables
4. Track progression via levels, bounty bonuses, achievements
5. Manage urgency via overdue corruption mechanics

## Near-term direction

- Keep recurring quest experience reliable and understandable
- Improve feedback around reward math (base, bounty, boosts, debuffs)
- Keep board + profile + market flows fast on mobile

## Non-goals (current)

- Complex cloud infrastructure
- Heavy onboarding or tutorial-first UX
- Documentation that duplicates code/OpenAPI details
