# Documentation Hub

Use this page as the single entry point for project docs.

## Start Here (in order)

1. `claude.md` — project quickstart + structure
2. `docs/current-architecture.md` — canonical architecture snapshot
3. `docs/api-contract-governance.md` — API source-of-truth workflow
4. `docs/documentation-index.md` — which docs are canonical vs contextual

## Day-to-Day Workflows

- Backend architecture details: `backend/claude.md`
- Frontend architecture details: `frontend/claude.md`
- Quest flow diagrams: `docs/quest-workflow-diagrams.md`
- Manual test checklist (quest-first): `docs/testing/quest-first-manual-tests.md`

## Context / Historical Notes

These are useful references but may be phase-bound:

- `QUEST_SYSTEM_NOTES.md`
- `12_01_26_plan.md`
- `backend/achievements.md`
- `backend/validation.md`
- `backend/error_codes.md`
- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_SETUP.md`
- `NFC_SETUP.md`

## Consolidation Policy

- Keep canonical docs short and current.
- Keep historical docs, but classify them clearly as contextual when needed.
- Prefer linking from this hub rather than duplicating the same guidance in many files.
