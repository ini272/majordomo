Concept:
NFC tags act as dumb triggers, not identity carriers.
User identity is resolved via the authenticated web session, not the NFC tag.

🔹 NFC Tag Content

Each NFC tag stores a simple URL:

https://majordomo.local/trigger/quest/<quest_id>


Optionally with metadata:

/trigger/quest/<quest_id>?source=nfc&zone=kitchen


No user data, no secrets.

🔹 Flow Overview

User scans NFC tag

Phone opens the URL in browser / PWA

Frontend checks auth state

if not logged in → redirect to login

Frontend calls backend trigger endpoint with auth token

Backend:

identifies user from session/JWT

resolves quest by quest_id

validates completion rules

completes quest, awards XP/loot

writes activity log entry

Frontend shows confirmation, animation, sound

🔹 Backend API (example)
POST /api/triggers/quest/{quest_id}
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>


Backend must not trust the NFC tag for identity.

🔹 Multiple Users

Same NFC tag can be scanned by multiple users

User is resolved via auth, not tag

Optional confirmation step if desired

�� Design Philosophy

NFC = “something happened here”

Web app = “who did it and what it means”

Trusted household model (no anti-cheat needed)

🔹 Optional UX Enhancements

Soft confirmation modal (“Complete quest?”)

Cooldown to prevent double scans

source=nfc for flavor text & analytics
