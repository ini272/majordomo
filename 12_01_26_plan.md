# Majordomo - Feature & Improvement Roadmap

**Status**: Infrastructure complete (TypeScript, Bun, CI/CD, Linting) ✅
**Focus**: Return to features, design, and gameplay mechanics

---

## I. OPEN QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE

### A. Philosophical / Game Design Questions

**XP System:**
- ❓ Is cumulative XP leveling the right feel? (Currently: Level 2 = 100 total XP, Level 3 = 300 total XP)
- ❓ Should levels unlock new features/content, or are they purely cosmetic?
- ❓ Do we want prestige/rebirth mechanics at high levels?
- ❓ Should XP rewards scale by user level (harder quests as you level)?

**Gold Economy:**
- ❓ What's the purpose of gold? Currently it's earned but barely spent
- ❓ Should rewards be consumable (one-time purchase) or unlockable perks?
- ❓ Do we want gold sinks (recurring costs, upgrades, customization)?
- ❓ Should there be a conversion rate (e.g., 100 gold = cosmetic avatar)?

**Quest Types Beyond Visuals:**
- ❓ Should "corrupted" quests have penalties (reduced rewards, time pressure)?
- ❓ Should "bounty" quests appear randomly, or only via daily bounty?
- ❓ Do we want difficulty tiers (easy/medium/hard) with multipliers?

**Daily Bounty Mechanics:**
- ❓ Is once-per-day frequency right, or should it be every 12 hours?
- ❓ Should bounties rotate through ALL templates, or only high-value ones?
- ❓ Do we want streak bonuses (complete 7 days in a row = extra gold)?

**Progression & Retention:**
- ❓ How do we keep users engaged long-term? (achievements, events, challenges?)
- ❓ Should there be weekly challenges beyond daily bounties?
- ❓ Do we want social features (leaderboards, home vs. home competitions)?

### B. Technical Questions

**Frontend State Management:**
- ❓ As app grows, should we add Zustand/Redux for global state?
- ❓ Currently refetching user stats after every quest - is this optimal?

**Backend Scalability:**
- ❓ SQLite is fine for solo/family use - do we plan to scale beyond?
- ❓ Should we add caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data?

**AI Scribe Usage:**
- ❓ Groq API costs - should we limit Scribe usage or add rate limiting?
- ❓ Do we want AI-generated quest descriptions to evolve based on user history?

- **Files**: `backend/app/routes/quest.py`, `backend/app/crud/quest.py`
- **Tasks**:
  - Define corrupted quest behavior rules
  - Implement multiplier or penalty logic in `complete_quest()`
  - Update API response to include corruption status
  - Add frontend visual feedback (red flash, warning message)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**3. Quest Recurrence System** (Medium Complexity)
- **Status**: Field defined (`recurrence: "one-off", "daily", "weekly"`) but not used
- **Tasks**:
  - Add scheduled task to auto-create daily/weekly quests
  - Prevent manual deletion of recurring quest templates
  - Track completion history for recurring quests
  - Add `next_spawn_date` field to track when to recreate
- **Files**: `backend/app/models/quest.py`, new `scheduler.py` module

  - Include error details in API responses
  - Frontend: Display user-friendly error messages
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

## VII. VERIFICATION & TESTING STRATEGY

### Manual Testing Checklist (per feature)

**Gold Spending (Marketplace):**
1. Log in as user with 0 gold
2. Try to claim reward → expect "Insufficient gold" error
3. Complete quest to earn gold
4. Claim reward → expect success, gold deducted
5. Refresh page → verify gold balance persists

**Corrupted Quests:**
1. Create corrupted quest template (quest_type = "corrupted")
2. Complete quest → verify 0.5x multiplier applied (or penalty chosen)
3. Check frontend shows red border + warning message

**Animations:**
1. Complete quest → see confetti/sparkle effect
2. Navigate between pages → see smooth transitions
3. Load Board page → see quests stagger-animate in

**Marketplace UI:**
1. Test on mobile (375px width)
2. Test with 0 gold, 100 gold, 10000 gold
3. Test with 0 rewards, 1 reward, 20 rewards
4. Verify responsive grid layout

### Automated Testing

**Backend:**
- Add pytest tests for new endpoints
- Test gold validation logic
- Test corrupted quest multiplier calculation
- Test achievement unlock triggers

**Frontend:**
- Add Vitest component tests (optional but recommended)
- Test Button component variants
- Test error states in Market page

---

## VIII. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

### Font Choice Recommendation

**Primary Font (Headings):** Cinzel
**Reasoning:**
- More readable than IM Fell English at small sizes
- Elegant medieval aesthetic without sacrificing legibility
- Works well on mobile
- Available on Google Fonts (easy integration)

**Secondary Font (Body):** Keep Georgia or switch to Lora
**Reasoning:**
- Georgia works well, no urgent need to change
- Lora is a good Google Fonts alternative if you want consistency

### Color Palette Expansion

**Proposed Additions:**
```typescript
// Add to colors.ts
export const COLORS = {
  // Existing colors...

  // New accent colors
  info: "#3b82f6",        // Blue for info messages
  warning: "#f59e0b",     // Amber for warnings

  // Quest type specific
  bountyGlow: "#9d84ff",  // Purple glow for bounty
  corruptedGlow: "#ff6b6b", // Red glow for corrupted

  // Gradient backgrounds
  heroGradient: "linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a 0%, #2d2d2d 100%)",
  questBoardGradient: "linear-gradient(180deg, #0f0f0f 0%, #1a1a1a 100%)",
}
```

### Asset Generation Strategy

**AI Tools for Assets:**
- **Character Portraits**: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (fantasy character prompts)
- **Icons**: Use icon packs (Flaticon, Noun Project) or generate with DALL-E
- **Textures**: Texture.com or Polyhaven (free PBR textures)

**Prompt Example (Midjourney):**
```
"medieval fantasy character portrait, warrior, stoic expression, dark background,
digital art, painted style, warm lighting, portrait orientation --ar 2:3 --v 6"
```

**Recommended Asset Sizes:**
- Hero avatars: 200x300px (portrait)
- Icons: 64x64px (SVG preferred)
- Backgrounds: 1920x1080px (cover full screen)

### Start With These 3 Items (Maximum Impact/Effort Ratio)

1. **Fix Gold Spending + Complete Market Page** (4-6 hours total)
   - Immediate functionality unlock
   - Users can finally spend earned gold
   - Completes core gameplay loop

2. **Quest Completion Celebration Animation** (2-3 hours)
   - High delight factor
   - Reinforces reward feedback
   - Low complexity, high visibility

3. **Font Upgrade + Color Palette Expansion** (1-2 hours)
   - Instant visual polish
   - Minimal effort
   - Foundation for future design work

**Total Effort**: 7-11 hours for substantial progress

### Next Steps

1. **Decide on open questions** (answer top 5-10 questions in Section I)
2. **Create WIP files** (`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `DESIGN_SPECS.md`, etc.)
3. **Pick a sprint** (Sprint 1 recommended for quick wins)
4. **Create feature branch** and start implementing!

---

**Questions for You:**

1. Do you want to tackle Sprint 1 (Quick Wins) or focus on a specific area first?
2. For corrupted quests, which mechanic appeals most: penalty multiplier, time pressure, or random event?
3. For fonts, should I proceed with Cinzel or do you prefer IM Fell English?
4. Do you want help sourcing/generating visual assets, or will you handle that separately?
